{

In this project, we compare the biometric gait of the human body using accelerometer sensor present in the smartphone.\newline\newline
The accelerometer data are acquired while the phone is in the trousers pocket in fixed orientation.\newline\newline
Data is then analyzed in time domain where average gait cycle is extracted for both legs, and their similarity is evaluated using Dynamic Time Wrapping.
